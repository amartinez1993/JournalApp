# JournalApp

## Description

JournalApp is a React-based web application designed to help you learn Redux while exploring various features such as user authentication, note creation, editing, and deletion, as well as the ability to upload and manage images in your notes. The application leverages Firebase Authentication for email and Google authentication and integrates with Cloudinary for image storage and management.

This project serves as an educational resource to help you understand how to build a web application with React and Redux, implement user authentication, and work with cloud-based image storage.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: JournalApp provides user registration and login functionality through Firebase Authentication. Users can sign up using their email or Gmail accounts.

- **Create, Edit, and Delete Notes**: Users can create new notes, edit existing ones, and delete notes they no longer need. The application uses Redux to manage note-related data and actions.

- **Image Management**: JournalApp allows users to upload and delete images within their notes. The images are stored and managed using Cloudinary's cloud-based image management platform.
